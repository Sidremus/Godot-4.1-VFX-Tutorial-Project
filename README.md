# VFX Tutorial Project for Godot 4

This project is intended to showcase how to build VFX in the Godot game engine (currently 4.1).

I'm in the process of editing a video for this first low-poly fire effect. Once that's up I will, over time, add more effect types and showcase how they can be built in Godot.
